# Specification Quality Checklist: Rule-Based Auto-Tagging

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-05-25
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain — all design decisions resolved in pre-spec conversation (same domain → regex needed; first-registration trigger; mark source; UI management)
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Builds on Phase 5 tag infra + Phase 2 AutoRegisterRule precedent
- ReDoS handled by anchor + length cap + complexity check (cold-path only)
- Ready for `/speckit.plan`
